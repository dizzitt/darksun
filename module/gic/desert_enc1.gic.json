Using the Tag..\r\n\r\nSPAWN_PLACETAGHERE_XXXX_XXXX\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nSPAWN_NW_SKELETON_OOOX_X_01\r\n\r\n1) You must Keep the \"SPAWN_\" Part in the front. \r\n2) Place the Tag of the creature you wish to Spawn in, Tag and ResRef must be the SAME. \r\n3) The Next \"_XXXX\" is time of Spawn in. First is Dawn, Day, Dusk and then Night. If a \"X\" is found in the Slot then that time of Day it will spawn in. If ANYTHING else is found then that time is not going to spawn the creature in. \r\n4) The Next \"_X\" is if you want the creature to Walk Randomly Around. To have him walk the Waypoints place a \"W\" there.\r\n5) The Last \"XXX\" is if you want to give him a unique TAG, usueful for custom waypoint following. Just place a Number in there, valid is 001-999 or use letters.\r\n6) Place the Waypoint down.\r\n\r\nLast. Example: \r\n\r\nSPAWN_NW_SKELETON\r\n\r\nLeaving off the extra will have the creature Spawn durring anytime of day and Randomly walk around.\r\n"
